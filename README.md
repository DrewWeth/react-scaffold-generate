# react-scaffold-generate

I used to do a lot of Ruby of Rails projects and loved the ability to generate a model, view, and controller for a model in seconds. It abstracted CRUD operations, form generation, form validation, basic list-detail presentation pages and fast forwarded every new project. 

This project is a port of `rails scaffold generate` and authentication Gem called Devise for React. It leverages templating, dynamic form generation, and simple Google authentication through Firebase.

Example usage:
    `react-scaffold-generate model Inventory name:string count:number description:string sku:string`
